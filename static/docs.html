    <h2>OP Codes:</h2>
    <p>Each op code is defined as: OPCODE - NAME - DESCRIPTION</p>
    <noscript>
        To see opcodes list, activate javascript (im lazy to add one by one)
    </noscript>
    <ul id="opcodes">
    </ul>
    <h2>Registers:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>AC (Accumulator)</li>
        <li>XR (X register)</li>
        <li>YR (Y register)</li>
        <li>SP (Stack Pointer register, 8 bit, decreased each push and increased each pop, default value = 255)</li>
        <li>STATUS (Status register)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Flags:</h2>
    <p>Carry flag (1 << 0), if the byte surpasses the 8 bit value, the value is set to true. (in subtraction/comparation, if the value in accumulator is higher or equal than the second argument (the value in a specified register), carry flag is set, example: 10 - 8, 10 is higher or equal than 8, so set carry flag)</p>
    <p>Zero flag (1 << 1), if the result of a logic instruction is 0, set to true</p>
    <p>Interrupt flag (1 << 2), if set to false, maskable interrupts is ignored, HOWEVER, non-maskable interrupts cannot be ignored</p>
    <h2>Special Addresses:</h2>
    <p>Default ip: 0x800</p>
    <p>Maskable interrupts: 0x803</p>
    <p>Non-maskable interrupts: 0x805</p>
